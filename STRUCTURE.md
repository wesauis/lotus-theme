# Project Structure

## Why

The Lotus Theme project aims to make the theme available to a variety of software, for that this project will be structured to allow these multiple targets.

**_This will be a monorepo :)_**

## Structure

- `schema/`: colors+ for the templates

- `template/`: theme template

- `assembler/`: code that will asseble the templates in build/dist

- `dist/`: packed theme

- `build/`: unpacked/assembled theme or some schemas to a future dist

- `CHANGELOG.md`: [global changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
